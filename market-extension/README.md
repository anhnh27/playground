This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Market extension usecases

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60454906/having-one-code-base-for-multiple-regions-and-clients

- Start with a common component `component.tsx`, and we want to make some changes for UK, the rest stay remain.. and release just that for UK
- without market extension: we need to modify the `component.tsx` -> there might be conflicts if someone also working on this file and we need to resolve then build... even if the changes from other is not for UK.
- with market extension: we just need to create a new file `component.uk.tsx` -> make changes and can release indepenently with other regions.
